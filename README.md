# Predicting NBA Success Across Time Horizons: From Season-Level Team Quality to Game-Level Outcomes

- Course: Data Bootcamp
- Project Type: Final Research Project
- Authors: Solomon Roy, Emiliano Eguez, Lucas Huang




## Project Overview

This repository contains our Data Bootcamp midterm and final projects, which together study NBA success across two different time horizons:
- Long-term success: What team variables predict next season win percentage?
- Short-term success: What variables predict the outcome of an individual game?

The midterm project focuses on season-level team quality using advanced NBA metrics and correlation analysis. The final project builds directly on this work by shifting to a game-level predictive framework, incorporating rolling statistics, momentum, rest, and matchup differentials.

Our core finding is that long-term team quality sets expectations, while short-term context (especially momentum) largely determines single-game outcomes.
